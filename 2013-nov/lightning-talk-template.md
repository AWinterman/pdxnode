# EnrollGo, 
## A Learning Management System (LMS) built entirely with Node

I've been selected to do a 5 minute pitch at NodeSummit in San Fransisco Dec, 4th for the [nodejam](http://nodesummit.com/nodejam/) contest. The pitch is about a new learning system Randall and I have been working on called EnrollGo built entirely with Node and Express.

I've been building successful custom LMS's for Wyndham Worldwide (Parent company of Super 8, Days Inn, Planet Hollywood, etc...), The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, BMW, and International Market Centers all in Node.js from the front to the back since v0.6.  

It's time to make an LMS for the masses, thus EnrollGo allowing companies of all sizes to join in at a fraction of the cost.
